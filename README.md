# ðŸ“– Copilot Workspace User Manual

## What is Copilot Workspace?

Copilot Workspace is an AI-native development environment designed to assist developers in completing everyday coding tasks. It provides a collaborative platform where developers can work with Copilot to explore, understand, and implement changes to their codebase. Copilot Workspace leverages natural language processing and integrated cloud compute to offer a seamless and efficient development experience.

Key features of Copilot Workspace include:
- **Contextual Assistance**: Copilot Workspace is deeply integrated with GitHub, providing context-aware assistance based on the repository, issue, or pull request.
- **Iterative Development**: Copilot Workspace encourages iterative development by allowing developers to review, refine, and iterate on AI-generated outputs.
- **Collaboration**: Developers can share sessions with their team, publish links to sessions on issues and pull requests, and collaborate on tasks in real-time.
- **Integrated Terminal**: Copilot Workspace includes an integrated terminal backed by a Codespace, enabling developers to build, test, and run their code within the workspace.
- **Task-Centric Workflow**: Copilot Workspace is designed around tasks, providing a structured workflow from task definition to implementation and validation.
